## Introduction:
<b>EDHUB</b> is an affordable video platform that will allow teachers to diversify their revenue sources and connect with their students at a more personal level.

"DONâ€™T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET", these are words to live by the over relience of small online educational institutes on a single platforms makes there structure very unstable which is not a great thing as if their institue closes, the lives of not just the teacher but also their students can be derailed. As a solution we offer <b>EDUHUB</b> a video shearing and streaming platforms specially for teachers and students where we provide not just the functionality to shear videos but also to take live video chating sessions with teaches.
